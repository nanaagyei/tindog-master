# TinDog Website

## Project Documentation

### Overview

TinDog is a fun, interactive website designed for dog owners. It provides a platform for users to find matches for their dogs based on their preferences. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

### Structure

The website is structured into several sections:

1. **Title Section**: This section includes a navigation bar and a call-to-action button for downloading the app.

2. **Features Section**: This section highlights the key features of the app.

3. **Testimonials Section**: This section displays testimonials from satisfied users.

4. **Press Section**: This section showcases the press coverage of the app.

5. **Pricing Section**: This section provides information about the pricing plans for the app.

6. **Call to Action Section**: This section includes another call-to-action button for downloading the app.

7. **Footer Section**: This section includes links to the app's social media pages.

### Styling

The website uses the Montserrat font family and a color scheme that includes #FF4C68 (pink), #EF8172 (light pink), and #fff (white). The CSS file `styles.css` contains the styles for the website. It uses media queries to make the website responsive.

### Future Improvements

Future updates to the website may include adding a form for users to sign up for a newsletter, integrating a blog, and adding more interactive elements like animations.
